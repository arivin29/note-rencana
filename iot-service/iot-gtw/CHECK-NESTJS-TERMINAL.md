# ⚠️ CRITICAL DEBUG NEEDED - Please Check NestJS Terminal!

## 🔴 Current Situation

✅ **Messages are being published** (confirmed)  
✅ **MQTT broker is healthy** (connection ok)  
✅ **NestJS is running** (process active)  
❌ **Database has 0 logs** (messages not saved)

## 🎯 **ROOT CAUSE: 2 Kemungkinan**

### Possibility 1: NestJS NOT receiving messages (subscription issue)
**Symptoms:** No 🔔 emoji in logs  
**Cause:** Still subscribed to old topic `sensor` instead of `sensor/#,device/#`  
**Fix:** Restart NestJS

### Possibility 2: NestJS receives but error when saving
**Symptoms:** See 🔔 but see ERROR (❌) after  
**Cause:** Database connection, missing table, or other error  
**Fix:** Check error message, run migrations

---

## ✋ **STOP - CHECK YOUR NESTJS TERMINAL NOW!**

### Look at the NestJS terminal where you run `npm run start:dev`

### Question 1: Startup Logs (scroll to top/beginning)

**Do you see this?**
```
[Nest] LOG [MqttService] 🔍 DEBUG: Attempting to subscribe to 2 topic(s): sensor/#, device/#
[Nest] LOG [MqttService] ✅ Subscribed to MQTT topic: 'sensor/#'
[Nest] LOG [MqttService] ✅ Subscribed to MQTT topic: 'device/#'
```

- ✅ **YES** → Subscription is correct, go to Question 2
- ❌ **NO** (only see "sensor" or "1 topic") → **NEED RESTART!**

**If NO, do this:**
```bash
# In NestJS terminal:
Ctrl + C    (stop)
npm run start:dev    (restart)

# Wait for "Subscribed to MQTT topic: 'sensor/#'" in logs
# Then run test again: ./single-message-test.sh
```

---

### Question 2: Recent Logs (after publishing test)

**After you ran `./test-and-verify.sh` or `./single-message-test.sh`**

**Do you see 🔔 emoji?**
```
[Nest] LOG [MqttService] 🔔 RAW MQTT MESSAGE RECEIVED!
[Nest] LOG [MqttService]    📍 Topic: sensor
[Nest] LOG [MqttService]    📦 Message (raw): ...
```

#### Case A: ✅ YES, I see 🔔

**Great! NestJS is receiving messages!**

Now check what happens after 🔔:

**Do you see ✅ at the end?**
```
[Nest] LOG [IotLogService] ✅ IoT log created successfully: <uuid>
```

- ✅ **YES** → SUCCESS! Check database again: `node check-iot-logs.js`
- ❌ **NO** → Look for ERROR (❌) in logs, tell me the error message

**Common errors:**
```
❌ Failed to create IoT log: Connection terminated
→ Database not accessible

❌ Failed to create IoT log: relation "iot_log" does not exist  
→ Need to run: npm run migration:run

❌ Failed to create IoT log: column "xxx" does not exist
→ Schema mismatch, need migration
```

#### Case B: ❌ NO, I don't see any 🔔

**NestJS is NOT receiving messages!**

**Possible causes:**

1. **Not subscribed to correct topic**
   ```bash
   # Check startup logs, should see:
   # "Subscribed to MQTT topic: 'sensor/#'"
   # If not, RESTART NestJS
   ```

2. **NestJS crashed/hung**
   ```bash
   # Check if still running
   ps aux | grep "nest.*iot-gtw" | grep -v grep
   
   # If not running, restart:
   npm run start:dev
   ```

3. **Config not reloaded**
   ```bash
   # Even after restart, check .env is correct:
   cat .env | grep MQTT_TOPIC
   # Should output: MQTT_TOPIC=sensor/#,device/#
   
   # If wrong, fix .env then restart
   ```

---

## 🚀 **MOST LIKELY FIX**

Based on your earlier logs showing `📡 MQTT Topic: sensor` (without `/#`), you need to:

### Step 1: Verify .env file
```bash
cd /Users/arivin29macmini/Documents/DEVETEK/pra-project/iot-service/iot-gtw
cat .env | grep MQTT_TOPIC
```

**Expected output:**
```
MQTT_TOPIC=sensor/#,device/#
```

**If different, update it:**
```bash
# Use your editor or:
sed -i '' 's/^MQTT_TOPIC=.*/MQTT_TOPIC=sensor\/#,device\/#/' .env
```

### Step 2: RESTART NestJS

**In NestJS terminal:**
```bash
Ctrl + C    # Stop

npm run start:dev    # Start again
```

**Wait for logs:**
```
[Nest] LOG [MqttService] ✅ Subscribed to MQTT topic: 'sensor/#'
[Nest] LOG [MqttService] ✅ Subscribed to MQTT topic: 'device/#'
```

### Step 3: Test again

**In another terminal:**
```bash
cd /Users/arivin29macmini/Documents/DEVETEK/pra-project/iot-service/iot-gtw
./single-message-test.sh
```

**Check NestJS terminal for 🔔 emoji**

### Step 4: Verify database

```bash
node check-iot-logs.js
```

## 📊 Quick Diagnostic

Run this and send me the output:

```bash
cd /Users/arivin29macmini/Documents/DEVETEK/pra-project/iot-service/iot-gtw

echo "=== .env Config ==="
cat .env | grep MQTT_TOPIC

echo ""
echo "=== NestJS Process ==="
ps aux | grep "nest.*iot-gtw" | grep -v grep | head -1

echo ""
echo "=== Health Check ==="
curl -s http://localhost:4000/api/health/mqtt

echo ""
echo "=== Database Check ==="
node check-iot-logs.js | head -20
```

## 💡 What to Tell Me

Please copy and send:

1. **NestJS startup logs** (first 30 lines after starting)
   - Especially the "Subscribed to MQTT topic" lines

2. **NestJS recent logs** (last 50 lines)
   - After running `./single-message-test.sh`
   - Look for 🔔 emoji

3. **Or just tell me:**
   - ✅ "I see 🔔 emoji but error: <error message>"
   - ❌ "I don't see any 🔔 emoji"
   - ❓ "NestJS is not running"

---

**Most likely you just need to RESTART NestJS!** 🔄

The .env has been updated but NestJS still using old config in memory.
